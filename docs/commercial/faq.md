### What are GoReplay PRO and GoReplay Enterprise?

[GoReplay PRO](https://goreplay.org/pro.html) and GoReplay Enterprise are extensions to GoReplay which add more functionality and provide additional support options for customers.

### Is there a trial version?

There's no free trial but we do offer a 14 day period with full refund if it does not work for you.

### What is the license?

See [COMM-LICENSE](https://github.com/buger/gor/blob/master/COMM-LICENSE) in the root of the GoReplay repo.

### How does PRO licensing work?

Every organization running GoReplay Pro on its own servers must have a license.  There's no limit to the amount of servers or environments used by that organization.

### How does Enterprise licensing work?

Every organization running Gor Enterprise on its own servers must have a license. There's **no limit** to the amount of servers or environments used by that organization.

### What happens if my subscription lapses?

You must have an active subscription to run GoReplay Pro or Enterprise.  After a one week grace period, you'll lose access to binaries and priority support.  You won't get any more updates or bug fixes.

### How do I buy GoReplay Enterprise?

Send email to [support&#64;gortool.com](mailto:support&#64;gortool.com) with your info.  A PDF quote will be emailed to you with the price.  Reply to that email with your purchase order or just "Sounds good" and we will send an invoice which can be paid with a credit card, ACH bank transfer or a paper check.

### Can I upgrade from GoReplay Pro?

Yes!  Current subscribers can upgrade by [requesting a quote](mailto:support&#64;gortool.com).  **Please note that you are an existing Pro subscriber.**  We will add a one-time discount on your first invoice to reflect any remaining Pro subscription credit.  If you purchased GoReplay Pro 6 months ago for $950, you'll get a $475 discount.

### Can I distribute GoReplay PRO or Enterprise to my customers?

This is a common requirement for "on-site installs" or "appliances" sold to large corporations.

The standard license is appropriate for SaaS usage as it does not allow distribution.  GoReplay PRO and Enterprise have an Appliance license option which **does** allow you to distribute them.  The Appliance license is $9,500/yr for Pro and $19,500/yr for Enterprise.  It allows you to distribute the Pro or Enterprise binaries as part of your application and each of your customers to run GoReplay Pro or Enterprise. Email [support&#64;gortool.com](mailto:support&#64;gortool.com) to purchase.

### Can you transfer a license?

Licenses are **not** transferable to another company.  We will transfer the license from a user-specific email to a group email address (e.g. john_smith@example.com -> tech@example.com) but only for **the same domain**.  It is strongly recommended that you buy the license using a group email address so the license is not attached to any one employee's email address.

### What does the license require me to do?

Your purchase gets you a unique access URL for downloading the Pro and/or Enterprise binaries.  The license agreement requires you to keep this access URL private.  If we find your access URL is ever publicized:

1. We'll send you a warning email with details.  You need to remove the content and send a new email address so we can generate a new access URL for you.  The old access URL will stop working immediately so you'll need to update your apps.
2. If your access URL is publicized a second time, we reserve the right to permanently remove access.

### Can I get a refund?

Yes, up to two weeks after purchase.  Let us know the reason and maybe we can help but either way it's not a problem.  Email [support&#64;gortool.com](mailto:support&#64;gortool.com).

### How do I update my credit card info?

If you purchased GoReplay Enterprise, there's nothing to do.  Each annual invoice is paid separately.

If you purchased GoReplay PRO, log into [Gumroad](https://gumroad.com) with your email address, click the Billing tab and enter your new card.  I can't provide support for the Gumroad website and don't have the ability to edit customer info - if you can't log in or change your credit card, you can always let your current subscription expire and purchase a new subscription.
