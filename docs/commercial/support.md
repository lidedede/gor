Gor offers only community support.  Gor Pro and Enterprise offer priority support via email.

## Priority Support

Covers 1 incident per quarter, with a max response time of 2 working days. Scope is limited to Gor and Gor Pro and Enterprise features and APIs, not the application or infrastructure.  For support, email **support** AT **gortool.com**.  Please email using the same domain as the original license email or explain your connection to the licensed company.

More aggressive support contracts (phone, quicker response time) are available separately, email with your needs.

## Onboarding

Enterprise customers may request a one hour video chat session with @buger to discuss their application(s), requirements and how best to leverage the various Gor features.  Contact support to set up your session.
