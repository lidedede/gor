Collaboration is difficult with commercial closed source but I do want to keep as much of the OSS ethos as possible available to customers who want to fix it themselves.

## Legal

In order to unambiguously own and sell Gor commercial products, I must have the copyright associated with the entire codebase.  Any code you create which is merged must be owned by me.  That's not me trying to be a jerk, that's just the way it works.

## Application

If you wish access to the product repository so you can send a PR, just open a new Gor issue and include the following info:

1. the email address that bought the license, a max of one collaborator per license
1. the following statement "I assign all rights, including copyright, to any future Gor work by myself to Leonid Bugaev"

You should be granted access to the private repo soon after.

## Notes

1. You should **never** work on the master branch.  Only I may merge changes.
1. I may revoke access for any reason at any time.  Access is not guaranteed with purchase.
